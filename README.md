# Neural Network Training Visualizer

## Overview
A web application that allows users to train a simple neural network on-chain by drawing digits and visualizing the learning process in real-time.

## Core Features

### Neural Network
- Single-layer perceptron or small multi-layer network implemented in Motoko
- Network weights, biases, and training data stored on-chain
- Support for digit classification (0-9)
- Forward propagation and backpropagation training algorithms
- Basic training step implementation using simple learning algorithm (e.g., single-layer perceptron update rule)

### User Interactions
- Canvas interface for drawing digits (28x28 pixel grid or similar)
- Submit drawn digits as training data to the network
- Trigger individual training steps on the network with manual training button
- View network's classification predictions for drawn digits
- Real-time visualization of weight and bias updates after training steps
- Clear all training data button to remove all stored training examples
- Reset neural network button to reinitialize weights and biases to default state

### Backend Operations
- Store and manage training dataset on-chain
- Execute forward pass to classify input digits
- Perform backpropagation to update network weights using basic learning algorithm
- Process training step requests and update network parameters
- Track training metrics and network performance over time
- Handle multiple user submissions and training requests
- Clear all training data and reset dataset to empty state
- Reset neural network parameters to initial random or zero values
- Comprehensive error handling for all backend operations with meaningful error messages

### Visualizations
- Real-time display of current network weights as visual grids that update after training
- Real-time display of current network biases that update after training
- Network performance metrics (accuracy, loss) updated after training steps
- Visual feedback showing network's confidence in classifications
- Training progress indicators
- Live updates of network state changes during training

### User Interface
- Clean, intuitive drawing canvas with clear/reset functionality
- Manual training trigger button to initiate weight updates
- Clear all training data button with confirmation dialog
- Reset neural network button with confirmation dialog
- Immediate visual feedback when submitting drawings
- Live updates of network state and performance metrics during training
- Real-time weight and bias visualization updates
- Simple controls for triggering training and viewing results
- Responsive design for easy interaction
- Loading states for all backend operations with visual indicators
- Error messages displayed prominently when operations fail
- Success confirmations for data clearing and network reset operations
- Disabled button states during processing to prevent duplicate requests

## Data Storage
- Training dataset (user-submitted digit drawings with labels)
- Network parameters (weights, biases)
- Training history and performance metrics
- Network architecture configuration

## Error Handling and Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling for all backend calls with user-friendly error messages
- Loading states for all asynchronous operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (clear data, reset network)
- Button state management to prevent duplicate requests during processing
- Graceful handling of network timeouts and connection issues
- Clear visual feedback for all user actions and system responses
